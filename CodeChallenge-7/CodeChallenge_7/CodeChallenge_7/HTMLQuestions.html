    1. The page should have the title (changes the tab name) Dangers of DHMO.<br />

    <title>Dangers of DHMO</title>
</head>
<body>
    2. Mark the first line with the tags for the biggest heading.<br />

    <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide Dihydrogen monoxide, also known as hydroxyl acid or DHMO1</h1><br />

    3. Give the next two words a strong (bold) appearance.<br />

    <b>is a</b><br />

    4. Emphasize (italicize) the first occurrence of hydroxyl acid and DHMO <br />

    <em>hydroxyl acid and DHMO</em><br />

    5. All numbers except the 2 in H2O should be superscripted l<br />

    <sup>H</sup>2<sup>O</sup><br />

    6. Mark the letters TM behind Styrofoam as superscript.<br />

    TM <mark><sup>Styrofoam </sup></mark><br />

    7. The 2 in H2O should be subscripted.<br />

    H<sub>2</sub>O<br />

    8 .Put paragraph tags around the different paragraphs of the article.<br />

    9. If you would like to keep the original spacing on the lists, you will want to use break tags after each comma<br />
